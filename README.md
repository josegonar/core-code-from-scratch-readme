<h1>SESSION 01, WEEK 01</h1>

<h2>Questions 1 & 2</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages</li>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Complied</li>
      <p>This type of program compiles, assembles or puts together the source code into an executable file. This file can be read by another machine with the same machine code. Observations: Faster, ready to run, source code is private, takes an extra step (compile), not cross-platform (pc and mac).</p>
      <li>Interpreted</li>
        <p>This tyoe of program makes a copy of the source code (public). Observations: Cross platform, simpler to test, needs an interpreter (slower).</p>
  </ul>
  <li>Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?</li>
  <p> Java is first a compiled into bytecode (by the Java compiler/JRE), bytecode is then interpreted by a Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Modern JVMs use JIT (Just in Time compilation) to compile the bytecode to native machine language.</p>
</ol> 

<h2>Pseudocode currency converter</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Start Program</li>
  <li>rate = Get 1USD TO BTC current exchange rate from x website</li>
  <li>amount = 0</li>
  <li>amount = ask user for the amount in USD</li>
  <li>final_ammount =rate * amount</li>
  <li>print final amount</li>
