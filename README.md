  #### **1. Interpreted And Compiled Programming Languages**
  - Complied: 
    This type of program compiles, assembles or puts together the source code into an executable file. This file       can be read by another machine with the same machine code. Observations: Faster, ready to run, source code is private,       takes an extra step (compile), not cross-platform (pc and mac).
  - Interpreted: This tyoe of program makes a copy of the source code (public). Observations: Cross platform, simpler to        test, needs an interpreter (slower).
    
  #### **2. Is Java compiled or interpreted, or both?**
  Java is first a compiled into bytecode (by the Java compiler/JRE), bytecode is then interpreted by a Java Virtual            Machine (JVM). Modern JVMs use JIT (Just in Time compilation) to compile the bytecode to native machine language.
     So, depending on the excecution enviroment, bytecode can be:
      compiled ahead of time and executed as native code (similar to most C++ compilers)
      compiled just-in-time and executed
      interpreted
      directly executed by a supported processor (bytecode is the native instruction set of some CPUs)
